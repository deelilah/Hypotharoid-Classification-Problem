# Week-8-IP
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients.

Hypothyroidism occurs when your body doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland that sits at the front of your neck. It releases hormones to help your body regulate and use energy.

Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:
a.) Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

1.2 Metric of Success
The goal for this project is to build a model that determines whether the patients symptoms indicate hypothyroid or not.

1.3 Understanding the context
Hypothyroidism occurs when your body doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland that sits at the front of your neck. It releases hormones to help your body regulate and use energy.

Your thyroid is responsible for providing energy to nearly every organ in your body. It controls functions like how your heart beats and how your digestive system works. Without the right amount of thyroid hormones, your body’s natural functions begin to slow down.

Also called underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism affects women more frequently than men. It commonly affects people over the age of 60, but can begin at any age. It may be discovered through a routine blood test or after symptoms begin.

1.4 Record and Experimental Design
Read and explore the given dataset.

Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.

Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

Check for multicollinearity.

Try and optimize each of the 2 models, making sure to document how you've set up your hyperparameters.

Identify which of the 2 models you trust most, and use your model to determine which features are most impactful in influencing the prediction

Provide a recommendation based on your analysis.
